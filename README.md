I'll create a complete instruction guide for building a full-stack Taxi Delivery App with Docker, Git, and GitHub Actions. This will include everything from project setup to deployment.I've created a comprehensive guide for building your full-stack Taxi Delivery App with Docker, Git, and GitHub Actions. This guide includes:

## 🎯 **What's Included:**

**✅ Complete Project Structure** - Organized file system for Laravel backend + React frontend
**✅ Database Schema** - All tables (Users, Drivers, Rides, Chats, Payments) with relationships  
**✅ Docker Setup** - Multi-container environment (MySQL, Redis, Laravel, React, Nginx)
**✅ Git Workflow** - Branch strategies and collaboration practices
**✅ GitHub Actions** - Automated CI/CD for testing and deployment
**✅ Development Instructions** - Step-by-step setup process
**✅ API Implementation** - Sample controllers and services
**✅ Production Deployment** - Server setup, SSL, and monitoring

## 🚀 **Key Features Covered:**
- **Real-time Location Tracking** (Redis + WebSockets)
- **Live Chat System** (Laravel Echo + Socket.io)
- **Google Maps Integration** (Routes, ETA, Distance calculation)
- **Payment System** (Multiple methods + local gateways)
- **Authentication & Security** (JWT, Rate limiting, Validation)
- **Automated Testing** (Backend PHPUnit + Frontend Jest)

## 🛠️ **Technologies Stack:**
- **Backend**: Laravel 10 + PHP 8.2 + MySQL + Redis
- **Frontend**: React 18 + Bootstrap 5 + Google Maps API
- **DevOps**: Docker + Docker Compose + GitHub Actions
- **Real-time**: Laravel Echo Server + Socket.io
- **Testing**: PHPUnit + Jest + GitHub CI/CD

## 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. **Initialize the project** using the Git setup instructions
2. **Configure environment variables** for both development and production
3. **Start development** with `docker-compose up -d --build`
4. **Set up GitHub Actions** by adding the workflow files
5. **Begin feature development** following the API examples provided

The guide is production-ready and includes everything from initial setup to automated deployment. Would you like me to elaborate on any specific section or help you get started with the implementation?
